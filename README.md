# Midi
I store my configurations during a journey to explore Midi in this repository.

<h1>RPI as sound module</h1>
This first step is to add a Raspberry PI as synthesizer between my midi keyboard and usb speakers, to make it sound like a piano, without extra digital step such as a DAW or analog step such as a soundcard or audio interface in between.



<!--
<li>Create fluidsynth.sh as included in [this repository](https://github.com/GeordieTomo/Fluidsynth/blob/master/fluidsynth.sh), and run <code>sudo chmod +x fluidsynth.sh</code> to make it executable</li>
<li>Create a <code>keyboard</code> file in the <code>inst/</code> directory holding the soundfonts of my liking.</li>
<li>Run <code>./fluidsynth.sh</code> to test that midi keyboard presses result in events shown in the cli and heared on the usb speakers.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Autorun</h2>
<ul>
<li>Update <code>~/.bashrc</code>, scroll to the bottom and add<pre>
./setup.sh wurli
</pre>Make that file executable as well, and reboot</li>
</ul>
<h2>Autologin</h2>
<ul>
<li>Run <code>sudo raspi-config</code> and select the "Console Autologin" boot option, under "Desktop/CLI".</li>
<li>Reboot. The RPI should run headless now, without the need to SSH into it again.</li>
</ul>
