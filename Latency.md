First I run a simple PoC to check if the latency of response to pressing keys on the midi keyboard can be managed via realtime scheduling. If this appears too slow I will need to install a linux low-latency kernel, and perform associated remediations. 
As I plan to use digital audio out, the USB interface will add latency, so this will be important.
